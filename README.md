# Exam Rank 02

In this exam, we were given 4 questions to solve. 1 question per level was given (from level 0 to level 3). As you know, these questions are randomly given and you cannot know or see the next question before you pass the current one. Because I don't have access to the codes I pushed during the exam, all the files uploaded were rewritten after the exam based on my memory. 

## Level 0 Subject ##
```
Assignment name  : ulstr
Expected files   : ulstr.c
Allowed functions: write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a string and reverses the case of all its letters.
Other characters remain unchanged.

You must display the result followed by a '\n'.

If the number of arguments is not 1, the program displays '\n'.

Examples :

$>./ulstr "L'eSPrit nE peUt plUs pRogResSer s'Il staGne et sI peRsIsTent VAnIte et auto-justification." | cat -e
l'EspRIT Ne PEuT PLuS PrOGrESsER S'iL STAgNE ET Si PErSiStENT vaNiTE ET AUTO-JUSTIFICATION.$
$>./ulstr "S'enTOuRer dE sECreT eSt uN sIGnE De mAnQuE De coNNaiSSanCe.  " | cat -e
s'ENtoUrER De SecREt EsT Un SigNe dE MaNqUe dE COnnAIssANcE.  $
$>./ulstr "3:21 Ba  tOut  moUn ki Ka di KE m'en Ka fe fot" | cat -e
3:21 bA  ToUT  MOuN KI kA DI ke M'EN kA FE FOT$
$>./ulstr | cat -e
$
```

## Level 1 Subject ##
```
Assignment name  : print_bits
Expected files   : print_bits.c
Allowed functions: write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that takes a byte, and prints it in binary WITHOUT A NEWLINE
AT THE END.

Your function must be declared as follows:

void	print_bits(unsigned char octet);

Example, if you pass 2 to print_bits, it will print "00000010"
```

## Level 2 Subject ##
```
Assignment name  : str_capitalizer
Expected files   : str_capitalizer.c
Allowed functions: write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes one or several strings and, for each argument,
capitalizes the first character of each word (If it's a letter, obviously),
puts the rest in lowercase, and displays the result on the standard output,
followed by a \n.

A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or
by the start/end of the string. If a word only has one letter, it must be
capitalized.

If there are no arguments, the progam must display \n.

Example:

$> ./str_capitalizer | cat -e
$
$> ./str_capitalizer "a FiRSt LiTTlE TESt" | cat -e
A First Little Test$
$> ./str_capitalizer "__SecONd teST A LITtle BiT   Moar comPLEX" "   But... This iS not THAT COMPLEX" "     Okay, this is the last 1239809147801 but not    the least    t" | cat -e
__second Test A Little Bit   Moar Complex$
   But... This Is Not That Complex$
     Okay, This Is The Last 1239809147801 But Not    The Least    T$
$>
```

## Level 3 Subject ##
```
Assignment name  : fprime
Expected files   : fprime.c
Allowed functions: printf, atoi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a positive int and displays its prime factors on the
standard output, followed by a newline.

Factors must be displayed in ascending order and separated by '*', so that
the expression in the output gives the right result.

If the number of parameters is not 1, simply display a newline.

The input, when there is one, will be valid.

Examples:

$> ./fprime 225225 | cat -e
3*3*5*5*7*11*13$
$> ./fprime 8333325 | cat -e
3*3*5*5*7*11*13*37$
$> ./fprime 9539 | cat -e
9539$
$> ./fprime 804577 | cat -e
804577$
$> ./fprime 42 | cat -e
2*3*7$
$> ./fprime 1 | cat -e
1$
$> ./fprime | cat -e
$
$> ./fprime 42 21 | cat -e
$

```
